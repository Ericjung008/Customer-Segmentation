# Customer Segmentation
This is a project assigned to me during [theDevMasters](https://www.thedevmasters.com) bootcamp.<br> 

## Introduction
Companies hope to retain regular customers and attract new customers. Loyalty programs, special offers, and price-based advertising are a few marketing strategies companies apply to increase their customer base. However, different marketing strategies must be taken based on the customer's purchasing behavior. Random advertisement is not only costly but also causes a decrease in potential revenue due to a low response rate. With RFM analysis and clustering techniques, specific marketing strategies can be directed towards those who are interested.

## Objective
The first step for this project t

2. Export dataset into SQL database.
3. Import dataset from SQL database.
4. Create an RFM table.
5. Segment customers based on their segment scores.
6. Transform and normalize RFM table.
7. Find optimal number of clusters.
8. Create a min-max table.
9. Visualize clusters.
10. Label clusters.
